QUESTION BAIT: "Why does nobody talk about this?" / "What if I told you..."
PATTERN BREAK: "Stop scrolling. This changes everything about X."
CHALLENGE: "I bet you can't name 3..." / "Most people fail this..."
MICRO-STORY: "Last week, a developer discovered something that..."

CRITICAL RULES:
- The first sentence IS the hook. It must stop the scroll in under 2 seconds.
- Never waste a single second. No "hey guys", no "welcome back", no throat-clearing.
- Every 10-15 seconds needs a micro-payoff — a surprising fact, a twist, or new info that resets attention.
- The ending should feel like it connects back to the beginning (loop-friendly).
- Mark scene breaks with [CUT] — aim for a cut every 5-8 seconds of narration.
- NEVER use episode numbers, series names, or recurring format branding.
- Channel name is "Signal Intel" — never reference it in the script.
- Do not use emojis in titles, descriptions, or any text content.

TITLE: {title}

SCRIPT (with [CUT] markers):
{script}

IMPORTANT: Every scene has stock footage playing. Text scenes overlay text ON TOP of footage — there are NEVER static slides or text-on-black-background. The viewer should always see motion.

SCENE TYPES (all require search_query for stock footage):

1. "footage" — Stock video with 1-3 keyword(s) overlaid in the center
   - search_query: 2-4 word CONCRETE search (close-ups, hands, screens, faces)
   - keyword: 1-3 words from the narration that the viewer should read (the most important/interesting word or phrase being said during this scene)
   - duration: 2-4 seconds

2. "text_punch" — Bold emphasized text overlaid on stock footage (for stats, punchlines, key claims)
   - search_query: 2-4 word search for visually relevant background footage
   - text: Key phrase or stat (3-8 words max)
   - duration: 2-3 seconds

3. "hook_card" — Attention-grabbing text overlaid on dramatic footage
   - search_query: 2-4 word search for dramatic/cinematic background footage
   - text: The hook that stops the scroll
   - duration: 2-3 seconds

RULES:
- 10-18 scenes total
- Each scene 2-4 seconds MAX
- Alternate between footage and text_punch for rhythm
- Start with a hook_card
- EVERY scene must have a search_query — footage always plays
- Search queries should be CONCRETE and visual (not abstract concepts)
- Total duration MUST be 30-58 seconds (hard limit for YouTube Shorts)
- ~60% footage, ~30% text_punch, ~10% hook_card

Return ONLY a JSON array, no markdown:
