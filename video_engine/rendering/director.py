"""Director Agent — creates a unified visual plan from a script.

Instead of separate shot plans, footage queries, and overlay cues,
the director reads the entire script and produces one cohesive plan
that specifies exactly what to show at each moment:

- Stock footage clips with specific search queries
- Stat cards (big numbers/text on dark background)
- Section title cards
- Text overlays on footage

Each scene has a type, duration, and all the info needed to render it.

SCRIPT:
{script_content}

SCENE TYPES YOU CAN USE:

1. "footage" — Stock video clip from Pexels
   - search_query: 2-4 word CONCRETE search (e.g., "person typing laptop", "city traffic night")
   - duration: 15-40 seconds (LET IT BREATHE — this is not a slideshow)
   - text_overlay: optional short text shown briefly on the clip (or null)
   - IMPORTANT: queries must be REAL FILMABLE scenes with natural movement
   - Think: what would a documentary show during this narration?

2. "stat_card" — Full-screen stat/number on dark background
   - stat_text: The big number or stat (e.g., "56%", "$3.2B", "10x")
   - subtitle: One line of context (e.g., "of Americans use AI monthly")
   - duration: 3-4 seconds
   - Use SPARINGLY — only for the 3-5 most impactful numbers in the entire video

3. "title_card" — Section heading on dark background
   - title_text: Section title (e.g., "The Paradox", "Why People Don't Trust It")
   - duration: 2-3 seconds
   - Use only at major topic transitions (3-5 per video max)

CRITICAL DIRECTING RULES:
- FEWER SCENES IS BETTER. Aim for {num_scenes}-{num_scenes + 5} total scenes, not 50+
- Footage clips should be 15-40 seconds each. Let them hold while the narrator talks.
- Only 3-5 stat cards in the ENTIRE video — the most impactful numbers only
- Only 3-5 title cards — at major section breaks
- Search queries should find PEOPLE DOING THINGS (not static objects or landscapes)
- Total duration of all scenes must equal ~{int(duration_seconds)} seconds
- 70-80% of the video should be footage scenes

Return ONLY a JSON array, no markdown:
[
  {{"type": "footage", "duration": 25, "search_query": "person scrolling phone cafe", "text_overlay": null}},
  {{"type": "stat_card", "duration": 4, "stat_text": "56%", "subtitle": "use AI every month"}},
  {{"type": "footage", "duration": 30, "search_query": "office workers at desks typing", "text_overlay": "Reluctant Adoption"}},
